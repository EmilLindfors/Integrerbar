Must Have functionality:

	Keeping track of who is working in the bar currently, in a period or all time and their role - implemented
	
	Keeping track of how many points the users have earned and log the points - implemented
	
	Enable transactions of points between the program and the user to add/subtract points - implemented
	
	Keeping track of days integrerbar will be/has been open and who will work/worked that day - partly implemented
	
	Letting users sign up to work for a day - TODO
	
	Show an electronic version of the internal verification card to the user - TODO
	
	
Should have functionality:

	Showing highscore for a select period, role etc. for a list of users - partly implemented
	
	Automatically calculate points earned for working a day - implemented
	
	Have a counter of how many days the users should work during a semester and subtract for 
	each day worked - partly implemented
	
	User Badges - Partly implemented
	
	Show calendar of days to come - TODO
	
	User profile for each user with points earned and spent - TODO
	
	Show the verification card on mobile with badges and other stuff - TODO
	
	Inventory system with stock keeping and ability to count items - TODO
	
	
	
Could have:

	Economy functionality - how much Integrerbar earned/spent each day - TODO
	
	Match inventory against economy to automatically estimate if any items were stolen, went missing - TODO
	
	Push notifications for new days added with the ability to sign up to work during them - TODO
	
	Contact users though the app - either by announcements or messaging - TODO
	
	
	
Would be really cool:

	Let users spend their usable points from their end by sending a transaction request to the system of eg. 
	
		User: Name Namesson requests 1 beer for 8 points Accept/deny
		
	Which would pop up for the bartenders on the pc or on mobile (if implemented for admin use) and they could 
	just accept if the user is sober enough and we have the item. This would automatically sort out everything else. 
	(System will only allow transactions if you have enough points and that use of points is enabled (only internfest).
